Introduction: Enel X has customers that participate in a special system peak program aimed at optimizing cost of energy in batteries. In this program, if Enel X storage or load is dispatched by our customers (ie, make their electricity load small) during the five highest hour long peaks in the year of the total grid, Enel X is rewarded at approximately $100/kW. The system peak program was designed by the local utility to lower peak electricity load on the grid. Thus, Our goal is working on a project that will help Enel X â€˜s customers to fully utilize the battery capacity and optimize the electricity cost.

## Software Dependencies

- Python 3
- Use `environment.yml` to create an environment


## Datasets
In this project, we mainly use three datasets, the actual demand data in the last four years, the top 2 forecasts of peaks on each day, and the top 12 forecasts of peaks on each day. The shared link to the datasets is [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ifAAAHJH6qRNGLICNbKe5Nt7yFHf-pTQ?usp=sharing)




## Documentation

`Hedging-Saving/data_functions.py`

This module contain functions to retrieve and process data from the database folder. 
With all these functions, we can predict our peak hour more accurate. 

```
from Hedging-Saving import * 		            # import module

data_functions.Accuracy(master_df,forecast_df) 	    # input two csv files and generate a new dataframe with "performance" and "hit rate" in each season.
```

Output:
